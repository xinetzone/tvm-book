    "Let's revisit the 2-D convolution described in :numref:`ch_conv` first. The 2-D convolution basically takes a 3-D data (note that for simplicity we set the batch size to be 1) in size `(ic, ih, iw)`, convolves it with a 4-D kernel in size `(oc, ic, kh, kw)`, and produces an output data in size `(oc, oh, ow)`. During the convolution, some padding and stride may be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For depthwise convolution, the convolution computation itself stays the same, as illustrated in :numref:`fig_conv_strides`. It differs from the normal 2-D convolution in the way of organizing the convolution. In order to generate an output data in size `(oc, oh, ow)` from input data in size `(ic, ih, iw)`, a two-stage computation is needed. First, we process the input data with `ic` kernels, each of which convolves with the corresponding channel, to produce an intermediate data in size `(ic, oh, ow)`; then we perform the normal, but pointwise, 2-D convolution on the intermediate data in size `(ic, oh, ow)` using a 4-D kernel in size `(oc, ic, 1, 1)` to produce the output data in size `(oc, oh, ow)`, where `padding=0` and `stride=1`.\n",

Therefore, we modify the `get_conv_data` slightly to handle the generation of the data for depthwise convolution, and save it for future use.\n"

    "## Depthwise Convolution in General\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why we want to replace a typical 2-D convolution into a more complicated, two-stage depthwise plus pointwise 2-D convolution. This book doesn't discuss about the choice of algorithms, but from the computational perspective, the main reason is to reduce the number of computation it requires. Assuming that the input data is in size `[ic, ih, iw]`, the kernel is in size `[kh, kw]`, and the output data is in size `[oc, oh, ow]`, a 2-D convolution takes $2 \\times ic \\times oh \\times ow \\times kh \\times kw \\times oc$ FLOPs, while a depthwise plus pointwise 2-D convolution takes $2 \\times ic \\times oh \\times ow \\times (kh \\times kw + oc)$ FLOPs. It is easy to see that the 2-D convolution normally takes more FLOPs than depthwise plus pointwise 2-D convolution, especially when the kernel size and/or the number of output channels are large. Taking the above example where $ic=256, oh=ow=12, kh=kw=3$, if we set $oc=512$, the total FLOPs of a 2-D convolution is $339,738,624$, while the depthwise plus pointwise convolution is $38,412,288$, almost one order of magnitude smaller, are much suitable for mobile and embedded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MobileNet paper :cite:`Howard.Zhu.Chen.ea.2017`, the depthwise convolution was described as a separable convolution which separates the channels for convolution. From another aspect, a depthwise convolution can be treated as a special kind of grouped convolution. A `G`-grouped convolution divide the channels into `G` groups and do the convolution group by group independently. This was first introduced in AlexNet to save memory. We can easily figure out that when the number of groups equals the number of channels, a grouped convolution is reduced to a depthwise convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, MXNet uses the same API `mx.nd.Convolution` to process depthwise convolution by specifying the number of groups, as we will show in the next code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a depthwise convolution can be generalized in other ways. For example, we can specify a `multiplier` to increase the number of channels for the output of depthwise convolution, which we are not cover for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing to Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "We use MXNet’s convolution operator as the ground truth to verify the correctness of our depthwise convolution. Before that, we will need to generate data. Like what with have done for TVM, we modify the `get_conv_data_mxnet` method defined in :numref:`ch_conv` to take `conv_type`. The data used for depthwise convolution in MXNet can then be generated accordingly.\n"
